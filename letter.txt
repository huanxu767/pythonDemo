We were both young when I first saw you
　　I close my eyes and the flashback starts
　　I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
　　See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
　　See you make your way through the crowd
　　And say hello, little did I know
　　That you were Romeo
　　You were throwing pebbles
　　And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
　　And I was crying on the staircase
　　Begging you please don't go
　　And I said
　　Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
　　I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
　　You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
　　It's a love story, baby, just say yes
　　So I sneak out to the garden to see you
　　We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
　　So close your eyes,
